I've created a complete browser-based billing system that implements exactly what you described:

## Key Features:

1. **Mobile Customer Lookup**: Enter mobile number to fetch customer info from local storage
2. **Auto-fill Inventory**: Add items with auto-complete from stored inventory
3. **Payment Methods**: Cash, Card, UPI with automatic ledger updates
4. **PDF Generation**: Creates downloadable invoices with company branding
5. **Local Storage**: All data (customers, inventory, transactions) saved locally
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Works on Chrome, Edge, and mobile browsers

## How to Use:

1. **Open** the HTML file in any browser
2. **Enter mobile number** - system fetches customer details automatically
3. **Add items** - start typing to see inventory suggestions with auto-fill
4. **Select payment method** - updates customer ledger automatically
5. **Generate Invoice** - creates and downloads PDF invoice
6. **All data persists** locally for future use

## Sample Data Included:

- Pre-loaded customers with mobile numbers
- Sample inventory items with prices
- GST calculations and tax handling
- Professional invoice formatting

The system works completely offline and stores everything in the browser's local storage. Perfect for small businesses that need a simple, effective billing solution!
